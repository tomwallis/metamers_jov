## Parameters for stimulus generation. See exp_8_stimulus_dev for calculation.

experiment_num: 10  # the number of this experiment (for saving stim).
eccent: 10  # eccent in degrees to centre the target patch.
pix_per_deg: 43  # number of pixels per degree
rms: 0.3  # rms contrast to use for the (global) stimuli
# sizes for presentation (including downsampling):
patch_sizes: [32, 64, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512]
background_size: 512  # the size of the background image (full crop).
patch_rms_min: 0.15  # the minimum rms allowable in a patch.
n_ims: 700  # the desired number of images

middle: 512  # max size of the middle patch in px

middle_centre: 10  # centre of the middle patch from fovea in deg.
middle_centre_px: 430  # centre of the middle patch from fovea in px.
middle_centre_img: 384  # centre of the middle patch in background image coords, px.
